# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Tell your human partner that SkillGrid works much better with access to subagents. The quality of its work will be significantly higher if run on a platform with subagent support (such as Claude Code or Codex). If subagents are available, use skillgrid:subagent-driven-development instead of this skill.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use skillgrid:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **skillgrid:using-git-worktrees** - Ensures isolated workspace (creates one or verifies existing)
- **skillgrid:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **skillgrid:finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

## Modules

[model:gemini-1.5-flash]
### Enhanced Anti-Loop Guardrails
Gemini models may exhibit looping behavior. If you detect repeating the same operation with identical results, stop immediately and report current state. Do not re-execute completed operations. Enforce strict output structure.

[model:gemini-1.5-pro]
### Enhanced Anti-Loop Guardrails
Same as gemini-1.5-flash. If you detect repeating the same operation with identical results, stop and report current state.

[model:deepseek-v4-flash]
### Tool Result Handling
Tool results may be truncated. Request specific file sections if output is incomplete. Prefer structured JSON over markdown prose when reporting results.

[platform:opencode]
### Platform Invocation
Invoked via tool call with skill descriptor. Return structured output matching the expected format. All file paths use forward slashes.

[platform:claude-code]
### Platform Invocation
Available as CLAUDE.md-activated skill. Follow Claude Code tool conventions. All file paths use forward slashes.
